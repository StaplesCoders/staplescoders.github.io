## Welcome to the Coding Club Stand!

You may be wondering, 

"*How did you make that??*"

Well, we focus on **fun and creative** projects like this in coding club, in addition to learning useful algorithms for courses at Staples and beyond!

Meanwhile, *please enjoy* the facial emotion recognition artificial intelligence project on display!

We hope that you will sign up for our club next year!

You know who to call if you need help with programming assignments!
