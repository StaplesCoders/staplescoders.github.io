Welcome to Staples Coding Club, a group of students focusing on learning new things related to coding! 

Our current club leaders are [Tom Zhang '23](https://engitom.github.io), Ryan Salik '23, and Graham Zemel '24. 

## How big is the commitment?
We understand that things get busy in high school, but we have weekly meetings where we do most of our work. 

## Is there a minimum experience level required to join?
Nope.

## How will this help me?
You will be able to show off your independent projects as part of your **portfolio** and apply techniques to future work!

## When and where is the weekly club meeting?
We meet in-person on **Wednesday, in Room 3025 from 2:45 to 3:45 PM**. 

Members are not required to come to every meeting. Feel free to drop in! 

## Which areas/skills are involved?
**AI and machine learning** are a major component of this year's coding club, as well as **web and game development**. 

## What kind of events will we attend?
External events that are taking place, including **hackathons** (like Wafflehacks and Rookiehacks), **game jams**, and **programming competitions** (such as USACO or Lockheed Martin's Code Quest). 

Prior to that, students can learn the necessary skills and techniques in **web development and game development**.

## What if my interests are not listed?
There are a lot of areas that intersect with computer science and it is difficult to cover them all, so feel free to introduce the club to anything you might be knowledgeable about, like environmental science or chemistry!
