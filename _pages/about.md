Welcome! We are the Staples Coding Club, a group of students focusing on learning new things related to coding! We aim to collaborate on various projects about whatever we are interested in!

Our current club leaders are Tom Zhang ('23), Ryan Salik ('23), Graham Zemel ('24). You can contact them to join the club or sign up using the form on the homepage!

## How big is the commitment?
We understand that things get busy in high school, but we have weekly meetings where we will do most of our work. 

## Is there a minimum experience level required to join?
Nope.

## How will this help me?
You will be able to show off your independent projects as part of your portfolio, and even apply techniques to future work!

## When and where is the weekly club meeting?
We will be meeting in-person on Wednesday, in Room 3025 from 2:45 to 3:45 PM. Members are not required to come to every meeting. Feel free to drop in just to try it out! 

## Which areas/skills are involved?
AI and machine learning are a major component of this year's coding club, as well as web and game development. 

## What kind of events will we attend?
External events that are taking place, including hackathons (like Wafflehacks and Rookiehacks), game jams, and programming competitions (such as USACO or Lockheed Martin's Code Quest). 

Prior to that, students can learn the skills/techniques used in those events, including web development and game development.

## What if my interests are not listed?
There are a lot of areas that intersect with computer science and it is difficult to cover them all, so feel free to introduce the club to anything you might be knowledgeable about!
